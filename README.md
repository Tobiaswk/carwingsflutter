# My Leaf

A NissanConnect EV app alternative written using Flutter

My Leaf is a simple, striving to be great looking, and fast alternative to the official NissanConnect EV app from Nissan.

You can ask your vehicle for the latest data, see current battery and charging statuses, see the current climate control state, start or stop climate control remotely, remotely start charging, and retrieve the last known location of the vehicle.

My Leaf is free and open source.
